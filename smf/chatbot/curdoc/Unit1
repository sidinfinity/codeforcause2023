         INTRO TO GRAVITY
      Gravity                       Gravity is defined as the force of attraction
                                    between two objects. All objects on Earth
                                    are attracted to Earth's center because of
                                    gravity. For example, when a ball is thrown
                                    up it comes back down because of its
                                    attraction to the earth's center. When an
                                    apple falls off a tree, it falls to the ground
                                    due to gravity.
                                    Every object has a gravitational force,
                                    however, it is proportional to its mass.
 Try throwing a tennis ball
up. It will always come back
                                    Objects with a larger mass have a more

              How Does Mass Affect Gravity?
    Now, you might be wondering, what is mass? Mass is the amount of
    matter in a physical object. Objects with large amounts of mass like
    the sun, have stronger gravitational fields and are able to keep
    planets in orbit.

  MASS AND WEIGHT



Try dropping a baseball and tennis ball at the same time. Record
the time the objects hit the ground. Visually these objects are
roughly the same in size but are made from different materials
and therefore have different masses. Your initial assumption may
be that the baseball will hit the ground first due to a larger mass..
However, the mass of an object does not affect when the ball hits
the ground. The force of gravity creates constant acceleration for
both objects resulting in both balls hitting the ground at the same
time.



   Mass VS Weight
                  Mass is the measure of how much matter is in
                  an object. For example, a filled water bottle
                  would have a greater mass than an empty
                  water bottle because there are more particles
                  inside of it.

                  Weight is the measure of gravitational force on
                  an object. On most regions of Earth, the weight
                  and mass of an object are the same, but for
                  planets like Mercury with a lighter gravitational
                  force, the weight would be much less than the
                  mass.

     WHY DO WE CARE
     ABOUT "GRAVITY"
 Have you ever thought of how beautiful
 the nature around us is? Well, then you
 have to thank Gravity. The only reason
 raindrops fall to the ground is gravity
 pulling them down. The only reason why
 plants can survive is due to the rain. The
 soil stays in the ground (most of it) and
 does not fly away when the wind comes
 due to gravity.




                        The playground is also full of gravity. Have
                        you ever gone down a slide before? Well, how
                        do you go down, Gravity? Whenever you
                        throw a ball, it comes down because of,
                        Gravity. The only reason you come down on a
                        slide is due to gravity Gravity. When you are
                        playing on the swings, the reason why you do
                        not start flying is because of Gravity.



Have you ever been to a beach and seen
waves crashing against the beach shore?
Well believe it or not, there is a high chance
those waves are caused by the gravity of
the moon and the sun. As the Earth spins,
some of the water is pulled by the gravity of
the sun and moon and causes it to rise as a
wave. Pretty cool right?

                  his weight, his movement can be varied
                dependent on his weight on a planet. If the
               astronaut weighs 150 lbs on Earth, how much
                does the astronaut weigh on other planets?

      WHAT IS FRICTION
By definition, friction is a force that opposes the motion of two objects
that are in contact. It exists in different forms, like kinetic friction,
static friction, fluid friction, and rolling friction. Since friction is a
force, it is measured in Newtons (N). Friction varies based on how
rough the surface is. In the real world, friction has many applications
like providing traction for shoes, which is helpful for sports, preventing
sliding, etc.




Friction Force                                  Velocity


             Important Definitions
 Friction: the force that opposes
 the motion of two objects in
 contact.
 Normal Force: the force that a
 surface exerts on an object that is
 on top of it.
 Friction Coefficient: a
 measurement of how much
 friction exists between two
 surfaces.
 Traction: the ability to stay on a
 surface without sliding.
 Air Resistance: the friction force     Air Resistance
 between an object and the air.

      USES OF FRICTION
Engineering
When engineers are designing
machines and objects like cars
and road surfaces, they rely on
and account for a frictional force.
For example, friction is used to
help the car slow down and stop
when a driver hits the brakes.




                               Sports Gear
                               Friction is also utilized in sports gear
                               in order to increase traction and
                               improve performance. For example,
                               sports shoes are crafted to provide an
                               appropriate amount of friction/grip to
                               minimize sliding.




  Medical Devices
 Friction is also used to improve the use
 of medical devices. For example, it may
 be used in surgical instruments to
 improve grip with flesh and organs in
 order to facilitate surgery and ensure
 that it is successful.

         WHAT AFFECTS
           FRICTION
     Normal Force
The normal force is the upward force that
the ground exerts on a solid object and
prevents the objects. The normal force
also affects friction and has a direct
relation to the friction force between the
object and the surface. When normal
force increases, the frictional force also
increases.

                                     its frictional force. For example,
                                     your kitchen tiles would have
                                     lower friction with the ground
                                     than carpet would as tiles are
                                     much smoother.




          Temperature
Surprisingly, the weather can also have an impact
on friction! Since many surfaces' properties change
as the temperature changes, their frictional forces
with objects may change with these properties as
well.
