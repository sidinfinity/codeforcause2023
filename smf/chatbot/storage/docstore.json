All objects on Earth\n                                    are attracted to Earth's center because of\n                                    gravity. For example, when a ball is thrown\n                                    up it comes back down because of its\n                                    attraction to the earth's center. When an\n                                    apple falls off a tree, it falls to the ground\n                                    due to gravity.\n                                    Every object has a gravitational force,\n                                    however, it is proportional to its mass.\n Try throwing a tennis ball\nup. It will always come back\n                                    Objects with a larger mass have a more\n    down due to gravity.            significant force of attraction.\n\n\n\n              How Does Mass Affect Gravity?\n    Now, you might be wondering, what is mass? Mass is the amount of\n    matter in a physical object. Objects with large amounts of mass like\n    the sun, have stronger gravitational fields and are able to keep\n    planets in orbit.\n\n\n                                                  9.8 m/s^2 (unit              Human Mass:\n                                                    of gravity)                   60 kg\n                                                       down\n                                                                       Earth Mass:\n                                                                    5.972 \u00d7 10^24 kg\n\n\n\n\n                                                   The Earth is very large compared to a human\n        Fun Fact: The Sun's gravity has an            being with a mass of 5.972 \u00d7 10^24 kg\n    attractive force that is so strong it keeps   compared to a human's average mass of 60 kg\n         the entire solar system in orbit!

Record\nthe time the objects hit the ground. Visually these objects are\nroughly the same in size but are made from different materials\nand therefore have different masses. Your initial assumption may\nbe that the baseball will hit the ground first due to a larger mass..\nHowever, the mass of an object does not affect when the ball hits\nthe ground. The force of gravity creates constant acceleration for\nboth objects resulting in both balls hitting the ground at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\n   Mass VS Weight\n                  Mass is the measure of how much matter is in\n                  an object. For example, a filled water bottle\n                  would have a greater mass than an empty\n                  water bottle because there are more particles\n                  inside of it.\n\n                  Weight is the measure of gravitational force on\n                  an object. On most regions of Earth, the weight\n                  and mass of an object are the same, but for\n                  planets like Mercury with a lighter gravitational\n                  force, the weight would be much less than the\n                  mass.\n\n\n\n                        1.1 GRAVITY                                   4\n     WHY DO WE CARE\n     ABOUT \"GRAVITY\"\n Have you ever thought of how beautiful\n the nature around us is? Well, then you\n have to thank Gravity. The only reason\n raindrops fall to the ground is gravity\n pulling them down. The only reason why\n plants can survive is due to the rain. The\n soil stays in the ground (most of it) and\n does not fly away when the wind comes\n due to gravity.\n\n\n\n\n                        The playground is also full of gravity. Have\n                        you ever gone down a slide before? Well, how\n                        do you go down, Gravity? Whenever you\n                        throw a ball, it comes down because of,\n                        Gravity. The only reason you come down on a\n                        slide is due to gravity Gravity. When you are\n                        playing on the swings, the reason why you do\n                        not start flying is because of Gravity.\n\n\n\nHave you ever been to a beach and seen\nwaves crashing against the beach shore?\nWell believe it or not, there is a high chance\nthose waves are caused by the gravity of\nthe moon and the sun. As the Earth spins,\nsome of the water is pulled by the gravity of\nthe sun and moon and causes it to rise as a\nwave.

XXX\n      WHAT IS FRICTION\nBy definition, friction is a force that opposes the motion of two objects\nthat are in contact. It exists in different forms, like kinetic friction,\nstatic friction, fluid friction, and rolling friction. Since friction is a\nforce, it is measured in Newtons (N). Friction varies based on how\nrough the surface is. In the real world, friction has many applications\nlike providing traction for shoes, which is helpful for sports, preventing\nsliding, etc.\n\n\n\n\nFriction Force                                  Velocity\n\n\n             Important Definitions\n Friction: the force that opposes\n the motion of two objects in\n contact.\n Normal Force: the force that a\n surface exerts on an object that is\n on top of it.\n Friction Coefficient: a\n measurement of how much\n friction exists between two\n surfaces.\n Traction: the ability to stay on a\n surface without sliding.\n Air Resistance: the friction force     Air Resistance\n between an object and the air.\n\n\n\n\n9                     1.2 FRICTION + AIR\n      USES OF FRICTION\nEngineering\nWhen engineers are designing\nmachines and objects like cars\nand road surfaces, they rely on\nand account for a frictional force.\nFor example, friction is used to\nhelp the car slow down and stop\nwhen a driver hits the brakes.\n\n\n\n\n                               Sports Gear\n                               Friction is also utilized in sports gear\n                               in order to increase traction and\n                               improve performance. For example,\n                               sports shoes are crafted to provide an\n                               appropriate amount of friction/grip to\n                               minimize sliding.\n\n\n\n\n  Medical Devices\n Friction is also used to improve the use\n of medical devices. For example, it may\n be used in surgical instruments to\n improve grip with flesh and organs in\n order to facilitate surgery and ensure\n that it is successful.\n\n\n\n\n                      1.2 FRICTION + AIR                            10\n         WHAT AFFECTS\n           FRICTION\n     Normal Force\nThe normal force is the upward force that\nthe ground exerts on a solid object and\nprevents the objects. The normal force\nalso affects friction and has a direct\nrelation to the friction force between the\nobject and the surface. When normal\nforce increases, the frictional force also\nincreases.\n\n\n                                             Material\n                                     The type of material that an\n                                     object is made with will most\n\n\n             vs\n                                     likely have a large impact on\n                                     its frictional force. For example,\n                                     your kitchen tiles would have\n                                     lower friction with the ground\n                                     than carpet would as tiles are\n                                     much smoother.\n\n\n\n\n          Temperature\nSurprisingly, the weather can also have an impact\non friction! Since many surfaces' properties change\nas the temperature changes, their frictional forces\nwith objects may change with these properties as\nwell.\n\n\n\n11                  1.2 FRICTION + AIR\n    TYPES OF FRICTION\n           Static                          Kinetic\n  Static     friction  is   the    Kinetic friction is defined as\n  frictional force between an      the frictional force between\n  object and the ground when       an object and the ground\n  the object is not moving.        when the object is sliding.\n  Static friction is the force     Kinetic friction depends on\n  needed to move an object         the roughness of the surface;\n  out of rest.
