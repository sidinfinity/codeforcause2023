Using        \nsatellites, radar, and other technologies, meteorologists study the      \natmospheric conditions that produce weather. Many meteorolo-             \ngists work as weather observers and measure factors such as wind         \nspeed, temperature, and rainfall. This weather information is then       \nused to prepare detailed weather maps. Other meteorologists use\nweather maps, satellite images, and computer models to make\nweather forecasts. Some meteorologists study climate, the patterns\nof weather that occur over long periods of time.\n\nAstronomy\nThe study of the universe beyond Earth is called astronomy.            \nAstronomy is one of the oldest branches of Earth science. In fact,               \nthe ancient Babylonians charted the positions of planets and stars     \nnearly 4,000 years ago. Modern astronomers use Earth-based and\nspace-based telescopes as well as other instruments to study the\nsun, the moon, the planets, and the universe. Technologies such as\nrovers and space probes have also provided astronomers with new\ninformation about the universe.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}}, "docstore/metadata": {"f43b97c9-2d48-4838-817c-ebc1369bf10a": {"doc_hash": "d7977a666d4997d0839345f12b716da7d615e55d10b45c11ea50de0458864307"}}}
