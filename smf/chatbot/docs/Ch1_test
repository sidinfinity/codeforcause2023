The study of Earthâ€™s atmosphere is called meteorology. Using        
satellites, radar, and other technologies, meteorologists study the      
atmospheric conditions that produce weather. Many meteorolo-             
gists work as weather observers and measure factors such as wind         
speed, temperature, and rainfall. This weather information is then       
used to prepare detailed weather maps. Other meteorologists use
weather maps, satellite images, and computer models to make
weather forecasts. Some meteorologists study climate, the patterns
of weather that occur over long periods of time.

Astronomy
The study of the universe beyond Earth is called astronomy.            
Astronomy is one of the oldest branches of Earth science. In fact,               
the ancient Babylonians charted the positions of planets and stars     
nearly 4,000 years ago. Modern astronomers use Earth-based and
space-based telescopes as well as other instruments to study the
sun, the moon, the planets, and the universe. Technologies such as
rovers and space probes have also provided astronomers with new
information about the universe.
