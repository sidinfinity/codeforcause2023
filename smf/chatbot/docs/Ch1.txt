                                       Why It Matters
                                       Scientists who study Earth explore
                                       the relationships among human
                                       society and the air, water, and soil
                                       of Earth. They also solve mysteries,
                                       such as how this heavy boulder
                                       moves on its own across a flat
                                       plain in Death Valley, California.

How Observant Are You?
Working in groups, make and record as many
observations about your classroom as you
can in 10 min. Use a magnifying glass, a
thermometer, and a meterstick to help you.
Compare your observations with the
observations made by other students.
Questions to Get You Started
1. Which of your observations were
  qualitative? Which were quantitative?
2. Think of a question about your classroom
  that could be answered by making more
  observations. What observations would
  you make to answer your question?

F or thousands of years, people have looked at the world around
them and wondered what forces shaped it. Throughout history,
many cultures have been terrified and fascinated by seeing volca-
noes erupt, feeling the ground shake during an earthquake, or
watching the sky darken during an eclipse.
    Some cultures developed myths or stories to explain these
events. Modern science searches for natural causes and uses care-
ful observations to explain these same events and to understand
Earth and its changing landscape.

The Scientific Study of Earth
    Scientific study of Earth began with careful observations.
Scientists in China began keeping records of earthquakes as early as
780 bce. The ancient Greeks compiled a catalog of rocks and min-
erals around 200 bce. Other ancient peoples, including the Maya,              Earth science the scientiﬁc

observations to create accurate calendars.
    For many centuries, scientific discoveries were
limited to observations of phenomena that could be
seen with the unaided eye. Then, in the 16th and
17th centuries, the inventions of the microscope and
the telescope made seeing previously hidden
worlds possible. Eventually, the body of knowledge
about Earth became known as Earth science. Earth
science is the study of Earth and of the universe
around it. Earth science, like other sciences, assumes
that natural events, or phenomena, can be explained
through careful observation and experimentation.

    Figure 1 El Caracol, an observatory built by the
    ancient Maya of Central America, is one of the oldest
    known observatories in the Americas. Mayan calendars
    include the celestial movements that the Maya tracked
    by using observatories.

More than a Pretty Picture
Scientists use a variety of instruments and methods to study
Earth. For example, common methods for studying climate
change include analyzing ice cores and tree rings. Now,

atmosphere blocks sunlight, which causes
temperatures to drop. Could painting shed

      The study of the universe beyond Earth is called astronomy.                 www.scilinks.org

                                                  Some Earth scientists study the ways in which humans
                                              interact with their environment in a relatively new field of
                                              science called environmental science. Many fields of study,
                                              such as Earth science, biology, and the social sciences,
                                              contribute to environmental science. The goal of environ-
                                              mental science is to understand and solve problems that
                                              result from how we use natural resources and how our
                                              actions affect the environment.

                                              The Importance of Earth Science
                                                   Natural forces not only shape Earth but also affect life
                                               on Earth. For example, a volcanic eruption may bury a town
                                               under ash. And an earthquake may produce huge ocean
                                               waves that destroy shorelines. By understanding how nat-
                                               ural forces shape our environment, Earth scientists, such as
                                               those in Figure 3, can better predict potential disasters and

A   rt, architecture, philosophy, and science are all forms of human
endeavor. Although artists, architects, and philosophers may use
science in their work, science does not have the same goals as other
human endeavors do.
    The goal of science is to explain natural phenomena. Scientists
ask questions about natural events and then work to answer those
questions through experiments and examination. Scientific under-
standing moves forward through the work of many scientists, who
build on the research of the generations of scientists before them.

Behavior of Natural Systems
    Scientists start with the assumption that nature is understand-
able, and they expect that similar forces in a similar situation will
cause similar results. But the forces involved in natural events are       Figure 1 Scientists use ice

issues, such as differences in climate.
    Scientists also expect that nature is predictable, which
means that the future behavior of natural forces can be antici-
pated. So, if scientists understand the forces and materials
involved in a process, they can predict how
that process will evolve. The scientists in
Figure 1, for example, are studying ice cores
in Antarctica. Ice cores can provide clues to
Earth’s past climate changes. Because natural
systems are complex, however, a high level of
understanding and predictability can be diffi-
cult to achieve. To increase their understand-
ing, scientists follow the same basic processes
of studying and describing natural events.

                                         Over time, the scientific community has developed organized
                                      and logical approaches to scientific research. These approaches are
                                      known as scientific methods. Scientific methods are not a set of
                                      sequential steps that scientists always follow. Rather, these meth-
                                      ods are guidelines to scientific problem solving. Figure 2 shows a

                                      gathered, a scientist may propose a tentative answer, which is also

                                        Accuracy and precision are important in scientific measure-
                                    ments. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true
                                    value of the thing being measured. Precision is the exactness of the
                                    measurement. For example, a distance that is measured in millime-
                                    ters is more precise than a distance that is measured in centimeters.
                                    Measurements can be precise and yet inaccurate. The relationship
                                    between accuracy and precision is shown in Figure 4.

Error
    Error is an expression of the amount of imprecision or varia-
tion in a set of measurements. Error is commonly expressed as
percentage error or as a confidence interval. Percentage error is
the percentage of deviation of an experimental value from an
accepted value. A confidence interval describes the range of values
for a set percentage of measurements. For example, imagine that              Percentage

world. A model is a description, representation, or imitation of an
object, system, process, or concept. Scientists use several types of
models, two of which are shown in Figure 5. Physical models are
three-dimensional models that can be touched. Maps and charts
are examples of graphical models.
    Conceptual models are verbal or graphical models that repre-
sent how a system works or is organized. Mathematical models
are mathematical equations that represent the way a system or

 Formulating a Theory
     After results are published, they usually lead to more experi-
 ments, which are designed to test and expand the original idea.
 This process may continue for years until the original idea is dis-
 proved, is modified, or becomes generally accepted. Sometimes,                        Academic Vocabulary

 research. Theories and scientific laws can be changed if conflicting
 information is discovered in the future.

 The Importance of Interdisciplinary Science
     Scientists from many disciplines commonly contribute the
 information necessary to support an idea. The free exchange of
 ideas between fields of science allows scientists to identify expla-
 nations that fit a wide range of scientific evidence. When an
 explanation is supported by evidence from a variety of fields, the
 explanation is more likely to be accurate. New disciplines of sci-
 ence sometimes emerge as a result of new connections that are
 found between more than one branch of science. An example of the
 development of a widely accepted hypothesis that is based on
 interdisciplinary evidence is shown in Figure 7.                                      Figure 7 The hypothesis that

Why It Matters

How Do Robots Go to Extremes?
Scientific observation is not always easy.
Earth scientists often need to go to
extreme places to make observations
and gather data. But some places are
too extreme, even for the most daring
scientists. How can scientists gather
                                                                                R

                               Make Observations
                               1 Examine the area of the puddle an
                                                                and the surrounding area carefully.
                                   Make a numbered list of what can be seen, heard, smelled, or felt.
                                   Sample observations are as follows: “The ground where the puddle
                                   forms is lower than the surrounding area, and there are cracks in the
                                   soil.” Remember to avoid making any suggestions of causes.


                               Form a Hypothesis
                               2 Review your observations

                                                               write possible hypotheses for those
                                   observations. A sample hypothesis might be “Cracks in the soil
                                   (Observation 2) may have been caused by a lack of rain
                                   (Observation 5).”
                               3 Review your observations and possible hypotheses, and place them
                                   into similar groups, if possible. Can one hypothesis or set of
                                   hypotheses explain several observations? Is each hypothesis
                                   reasonable when compared with the others? Does any hypothesis
                                   contradict any of the other observations?

Test the Hypothesis

                     hypotheses, ma
                                 make some predictions about what
    will happen at the puddle as conditions change. Describe the
    changes you expect and your reasoning. A sample prediction is the
    following: “If the puddle dries out, the crack will grow wider
    because of the loss of water.”
5 Revisit the puddle several times to see if the changes that you
    observe match your predictions.

                                                                                 Step 2
Analyze the Results
1. Evaluating Results Which of your predictions were correct, and
1
   which predictions were incorrect?
2. Analyzing Methods Which of your senses did you use most to
   make your observations? How could you improve your observations
   by using this sense? by using other senses?
3. Evaluating Methods What could you have used to measure, or
   quantify, many of your observations? Is quantitative observation
   better than qualitative observation? Explain your answer.


Draw Conclusions
4. Drawing Conclusions Examine your incorrect predictions. What
4
   new knowledge have you gained from them?
5. Analyzing Results Reexamine your hypotheses. What can you say
   now about the ones that were correct?
6. Drawing Conclusions When knowledge is derived from
   observation and prediction, this process uses scientific methods. After
   reporting the results of a prediction, how might a scientist continue
   his or her research?
