   FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
                    What is the flow of electricity?
                    Similarly to how water flows in pipes, electricity
                    flows through its own type of pipes. Wires,
                    conductors, and other electrically conductive
                    materials provide a path that electricity needs to
                    flow, also known as an electrical current. This
                    current travels through the wires from a power
                    source, such as a battery or a power plant, to the
                    appliance you want to use, such as a TV. Electricity
                    has become a daily part of our lives. From a lightbulb
                    to a charger to the massive satellites in orbit, which
                    all require electricity, our society now depends upon
                    electricity.


What does the flow look like?
Electricity is a type of energy that flows
through wires to power devices, but it's
not something we can see with our eyes. If
we could, it might look like a bright and
fast-moving spark, but in reality, we must
use other ways to know when electricity is
flowing. For example, we can tell when
electricity is flowing by the devices that
turn on, like a light bulb or a fan, as the
functioning of the utility shows the flow.
Even though we can't see the flow of
electricity literally, we can still tell when
it's flowing as it powers devices and makes
them work.

 PROTONS, ELECTRONS,
    AND NEUTRONS
The flow of electrons in the flow of electricity is
called electric current. Electric current is measured
in units of amperes (often shortened to "amps"),
which is the rate at which electric charge flows
through a material. When a large number of
electrons are moving through a material, the
electric current is strong, and when fewer electrons
are moving, the electric current is weaker.


                                     Electrons, protons, and neutrons play
                                     a crucial role in the flow of electricity.
                                     Electricity is the movement of electric
                                     charge, and the electric charge is
                                     carried by electrons. In an atom,
                                     electrons are negatively charged
                                     particles that orbit around the
                                     positively charged nuclei, which are
                                     made up of protons and neutrons.


The flow of electricity is directly related
to the movement of electrons. When an
electric field is applied to a material, it
causes the electrons to move, creating
an electric current. The number of
electrons and protons in an atom affects
its electrical properties, as materials with
an excess of electrons are said to be
negatively charged, while materials with
fewer electrons are said to be positively
charged.

PROTONS, ELECTRONS,
   AND NEUTRONS
This relationship between electrons, protons,
and the flow of electricity can be understood
through the concept of electric charge.
Electric charge is a fundamental property of
matter and is determined by the number of
electrons and protons in an atom. When there
are more electrons than protons in an atom, it
is negatively charged; when there are more
protons than electrons, it is positively
charged.




                      In conclusion, electrons, protons, and neutrons
                      all play a role in the flow of electricity. Electrons
                      carry the electric charge and determine the
                      electrical properties of a material, and the
                      movement of electrons creates the electric
                      current. The number of electrons and protons in
                      an atom also affects its electrical properties and
                      the flow of electricity.

                    LIGHTNING

Why does Lightning Occur?
Lightning occurs when there is a buildup of
electrical charge in the atmosphere,
usually in the form of thunderstorms. Air
acts as an insulator between the positive
and negative charges in the cloud and
between the cloud and the ground. When
the opposite charges build up enough, this
insulating capacity of the air breaks down,
and there is a rapid discharge of electricity
that we know as lightning.

55                2.1 ELECTRICITY
               APPLICATION
Why this works?
Atoms are made up of protons with a positive charge, neutrons with no
charge, and electrons with a negative charge. Typically, the positive and
negative charges in an atom balance each other out, making the atom
and the object it composes neutral in charge. However, when two
objects are rubbed together, some electrons may transfer, causing one
object to become positively charged and the other negatively charged.
This leads to their attraction due to their opposite charges. Static
electricity is less likely to build up on humid days because the charged
particles attach to the water molecules in the air.




The buildup of static electricity can be a useful phenomenon, but it can
also be problematic in certain situations. For example:
   Static electricity can pose a risk of fire or explosions in environments
   with flammable materials, such as gas stations, chemical plants, or
   grain silos.
   Static electricity buildup can cause discomfort or pain when it
   discharges through our bodies, such as when we get a shock from a
   doorknob or a car door.
   Static electricity can interfere with sensitive electronic equipment,
   such as in manufacturing plants or hospitals, where it can cause
   malfunctions or damage to equipment.
   Static electricity can attract dust and other particles, leading to
   cleanliness issues in certain environments, such as laboratories or
   clean rooms.

           HISTORY BEHIND
              MAGNETS
                             It was discovered that certain stones,
                             known as lodestones, could attract iron at
                             the beginning of magnetism's history. In
                             200 BC, the Chinese were the first to
                             record the usage of lodestones for
                             navigation. William Gilbert, an English
                             physician, studied magnetism through
                             experiments in the 16th century and
                             produced "De Magnete," which is regarded
                             as the first comprehensive analysis of
                             magnetism. He found that the Earth had a
                             north and south magnetic pole and
                             functioned as a gigantic magnet.


Electric currents produce magnetic fields,
as Hans Christian Oersted of Denmark
discovered     in   the   19th   century.
Electromagnets, which are utilized in
many modern technologies, including
motors and generators, were developed in
effect. The development of permanent
magnets(ex. fridges) and magnetic storage
technologies like hard drives and credit
cards were made possible by the
discovery of magnetic materials like iron,
nickel, and cobalt.

Nowadays, magnetism is employed for various purposes, from
renewable energy sources like wind turbines to diagnostic imaging. With
ongoing investigations into novel materials and future uses, it is still a
crucial area for study and innovation.

         HOW DO MAGNETIC
          FIELDS BEHAVE
                    What is a magnetic field?
                    Magnetic fields are invisible force fields that surround
                    magnets or moving electric charges. They're created
                    by the movement of electric charges, such as
                    electrons, which generate electric currents. These
                    currents generate magnetic fields. Even though they
                    can't be seen, they can be detected with instruments
                    like compasses or magnetometers. The behavior of
                    magnetic fields is determined by the size and direction
                    of the electric currents and magnetic materials
                    involved, making them constantly changing and a bit
                    unpredictable.


Nature of a magnet
Magnetic fields have a dipolar nature, meaning they have a north and south
pole. This dipolar nature arises from the orientation of the electrons within
the magnetic material. The same poles repel each other, while opposite
poles attract. The strength of the magnetic field is strongest at the poles
and weaker further away. Magnetic fields can also pass through non-
magnetic materials, such as air, water, and plastic, making them ideal for
various applications.


Applications
Magnets and electric charges generate magnetic fields that surround us.
These fields power electronic devices such as generators, motors,
transformers, and even hard drives. Magnetic fields are essential for medical
imaging, particularly MRI scans, which capture detailed images of our organs
and tissues. Magnetic fields are also behind credit card production, security
systems, and the levitation of high-speed trains. These unique properties
make magnetic fields ideal for use in transportation, medicine, and
telecommunications.

                                                Molten Iron




The melting iron in the Earth's core is in constant motion and
generates electric currents, producing a magnetic field. This magnetic
field has North and South Poles, similar to a bar magnet. The Earth's
magnetic field is created by the motion of this molten iron, which is
heated by the planet's internal processes.

                           Effect on Earth
                          Earth's magnetic field is generated by the
                          motion of molten iron in its core, creating a
                          magnetic field with North and South Poles.
                          These poles are close to the geographic
                          North and South Poles. The Earth's magnetic
                          field protects the planet from harmful
                          cosmic radiation and charged particles from
                          the Sun and causes beautiful phenomena
                          such as the aurora borealis and aurora
                          australis.

                          The Earth's magnetic field is a vital force
                          that protects life on our planet by deflecting
                          harmful cosmic radiation and charged
                          particles from the Sun. This shield is critical
                          for preventing harm to living organisms.




61                         2.2 MAGNET
       WHAT MATERIALS
        ARE MAGNETIC
Some basic materials are magnetic.
Examples include iron, nickel, and
cobalt. These metals can produce
magnetic moments because each of
them has an outer electron shell
that is partially filled. The electrons
part of this outer shell makes it so
that it attracts the protons. These
magnetic moments are the product
of the electrons' orbital motion and
spin, which produce a magnetic
field.




                                    Individual     atoms'    magnetic
                                    moments line up with one

                                    materials like iron, nickel, and
                                    cobalt to produce a potent net
                                    magnetic field. An external
                                    magnetic field can induce this
                                    alignment, producing a magnet
                                    that keeps its magnetization even
                                    when the external field is
                                    removed.

     TYPES OF MAGNETS
The strongest permanent magnets now on Earth
are neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) magnets.
They are created by adding neodymium, iron, and
boron in a precise ratio, followed by the
application of a powerful magnetic field. As the
generated magnet has a high energy density, it
can be applied to many different things, such as
electric motors and generators. Because the
electron arrangement of materials like paper,
glass, and rubber prevents the formation of
magnetic moments, these substances are not
magnetic. These materials' shifting electron
velocities cancel out any magnetic fields that
individual atoms might have produced.




In conclusion, the behavior of a material's electrons determines whether
it has magnetic properties. Metals with partially full outer electron
shells, like iron, nickel, and cobalt, can produce magnetic moments and
a net magnetic field. The strongest permanent magnets now on the
market are neodymium magnets (made with iro﻿n boron (NdFeB) ). Due
to their electron arrangement, other materials, including paper, glass,
and rubber, do not possess magnetic characteristics.

            2.3 HOW DO CIRCUITS WORK              66
    CIRCUITS: THE FLOW
      OF ELECTRICITY
                     What is a circuit?
                     An electric circuit is a closed loop that electricity
                     passes through. It can be oriented in almost any
                     shape and size. The circuit is made from individual
                     components—for example, battery, light bulb, wires,
                     etc. When all these components are put together in
                     a certain shape, it creates a path for electricity can
                     flow continuously. When a switch is installed on the
                     circuit, you can manually control the flow of
                     electricity in the circuit.


What is a closed and open circuit?
As mentioned above, a circuit is a
closed path that helps flow electricity
effortlessly. A circuit is called a
"closed circuit" when there is no
disturbance in the connection and
the shape is complete. When there
are no gaps, the electricity passes
through quickly.

                             Now we all know what a closed circuit is. On
                             the other hand, an open circuit is the
                             opposite of a closed circuit. When the
                             connection is broken, electricity stops
                             flowing, causing the bulb not to work. This
                             is caused by a bad connection on the
                             battery, a light switch in the off position,
                             and more. An open circuit would mean that
                             electrons would be lost from the system.


67               2.3 HOW DO CIRCUITS WORK
          COMPONENTS OF
             CIRCUIT
                    The battery is the primary power source for the

  Battery           electric circuit. It provides a source of energy for the
                    light bulb to turn on. However, using only one
                    battery for an electric circuit is not necessary. You
                    can run dual batteries if the bulb consumes more
                    power. On a regular battery, there are two
                    components, i.e one at the top and one at the
                    bottom. Those components are called terminal ends,
                    and they are represented as "+" and "-" as shown in
                    the diagram given. The "+" symbol at the top
                    represents the positive terminal. On the other hand,
                    the "-" represents the negative terminal.


                                                     Wires
The wires in an electric circuit help with the
flow of electricity from the battery to the
light bulb so that it can turn on. The wires
are connected directly from the terminal
ends of the battery to the connection
points on the light bulb. In some circuits,
the wires are connected to a light switch. If
the wires are damaged or split anywhere,
the flow of the electricity can get
disturbed, and the circuit becomes open.


      Loads
                         The light bulb is the most common load also
                         one of the most critical components in the
                         electric circuit because it lets us know if the
                         electricity in the circuit is flowing or not. If the
                         bulb does not light up, the battery could be
                         dead, or there is a problem with a circuit, such
                         as a broken wire, causing it to become an open
                         circuit.


                 2.3 HOW DO CIRCUITS WORK                              68
             CIRCUIT TYPES

                             What is a Series Circuit?
                             The series-type circuit lives up to its name.
                             The light bulbs are connected in one path,
                             and they are controlled by one light switch.
                             With series circuits, you do have a few
                             advantages and disadvantages. One of the
                             advantages is that you can power
                             everything with one switch. In a series
                             circuit, the electricity flows clockwise and
                             completes one loop. But on the other hand,
                             it does have its disadvantages. One of them
                             is that the whole system will shut down if
                             the connection becomes open.



What is a Parallel Circuit?
The parallel type circuit is the opposite
of a series circuit. The difference
between the two circuits is that both
light bulbs are oriented parallelly. It is
also connected separately from the
series circuit, where the bulbs are
connected on one path. A parallel circuit
also has its own advantages and
disadvantages. One advantage is that if
one wire is broken or disconnected, the
whole system won't shut off; the other
bulb will stay on. The disadvantage is
that both bulbs use the same battery,
which stresses the battery.


69               2.3 HOW DO CIRCUITS WORK
       ALTERNATING AND
       DIRECT CURRENT
What is Alternating Current?
 Alternating Current          An alternating current is where the
                              electricity in the circuit reverses at a
                              specific time, which happens periodically.
                              Alternating     current    has    its    own
                              advantages and disadvantages. One of the
                              advantages of AC (Alternating Current ) is
                              that it is less expensive to generate than
                              DC (Direct Current). AC current is capable
                              of traveling long distances. One of the
                              disadvantages of AC current is that high
                              voltage is used. High voltage can be very
                              dangerous to work with because there is
                              an increased risk of electric shock. AC
                              current is regularly used for electricity.


What is Direct Current?
Direct Current is the current that flows        Direct Current
straight in one path. Direct Current or DC
does not reverse periodically. DC current
also has its own advantages and
disadvantages. One advantage is DC
current is that you can regulate the
current flow in the circuit, for example
regulating the speed of a regular DC
motor. One disadvantage of DC current is
that the maintenance cost is very high
compared to an Alternating Current. DC
current is regularly used for electronics.


                2.3 HOW DO CIRCUITS WORK                           70
   SAFETY COMPONENTS
What is a Electric Fuse?
Unlike light switches, fuses are safety components of
every major circuit. It prevents damage to electrical
components. The fuse is rated at a specific current rating
until it blows and creates an open course. An electric
fuse has a thin metal coil inside where the current flows.
If there is too much electricity flowing, for example, 30
volts flowing through a fuse rated at 20 volts, it
overheats the coil, and the metal separates, causing the
connection to split. If something like that happens, the
solution is to swap it out with another 20 volts fuse. A
fuse with a higher rating should not be replaced with it.
For example, if a 20-volt electrical appliance is
connected to the circuit and you install a 30-volt fuse,
the electricity flow might be excess. If that happens, the
appliance will get ruined.

         What is a Miniature Circuit Breaker?
                 Miniature circuit breakers, or MCBs, are another safety
                 component in an electric circuit. This works the same
                 way how a fuse works. It has a limitation on the flow of
                 electricity. MCBs can also work like a light switch in the
                 circuit. The only difference is that a light switch won't
                 do anything in case of a current increase. Whenever the
                 current flowing in the MCB is unusually high, it
                 immediately trips the switch causing the connection to
                 cut off. If that happens, we can instantly flip the switch
                 back to the on position and not spend any money on a
                 fuse. It is also very helpful when it comes to doing
                 electrical work. You can instantly cut the power by
                 flipping a light switch without removing any fuses.

Now, you might be wondering, how does a circuit affect us?

                                              Circuits provide every utility
                                              that is around you. For the

  Magnets in Nature & their Applications
              There are only a few natural magnets in nature. Although
              they may not seem important, they are responsible for
              many of the magnetic properties found in magnets today.
              Many magnets are usually made as an alloy (a combination
              of raw metals and heat) of these metals, resulting in a
              powerful magnet.

Magnets in our Daily Lives
Like circuits, magnets play a big role in our lives.
Much of modern transportation relies on
magnets as motors, which power the wheels on
cars and motorcycles, are made by their
properties. Additionally, the faster train on Earth
right now is the Magent-based bullet train in
Japan. Have you ever experienced going to the
dentist? Well, then you have experienced the
force of a magnet! X-rays that doctors take of
your teeth use magnets to see, well, your teeth!
Much of modern medicine also contains
magnets.

   CIRCUITS & MAGNETS:
      RELATIONSHIPS
Their Mutual Connection
Electricity and Magnetism are closely related. They have an
inverse relationship, in which flowing electrons from an electric
field will produce a magnetic field, and spinning magnets can
create an electric current.




Many applications of circuits and magnets use a combination of
both electricity and magnets. For example, a motor uses
electricity (powered by gas or some equivalent) to start itself
and spins magnets really fast to generate electricity for the car
to run on.



77                      2.4 CIRCUITS
   ELECTROMAGNETISM
The Combination
What happens when a magnetic field and an electric field combine?
Well, you get something called electromagnetism. This force is one of
the four fundamental forces of nature, as creates a new sort of field,
titled: the electromagnetic field. The electromagnet force is what binds
atoms together and allows magnets to work. The concept of
electromagnetism was proved by Albert Einstein, as he showed the
relationship between both electric and magnetic forces.


Electromagnetic Spectrum
Electromagnetism also describes the various kinds of
waves in our everyday science. Thanks to a specific
spectrum of electromagnetic waves, we can do
multiple different tasks in our daily lives. These
waves are radio waves and microwaves to X-rays and
gamma rays.
The visible light spectrum is just a tiny part of the electromagnetic
spectrum, and it contains the wavelengths for all the colors visible to the
human eye. The spectrum works by sorting the different waves by
frequency, or number of wave cycles per second, with radio waves having
the lowest frequency, the longest wave length, and gamma rays having
the highest frequency, the shortest wavelength. This is why a sunset is
red and orange, as those colors can disperse in the sky easier due to their
longer wavelengths, which allow them to travel longer distances.




Electromagnetism plays a crucial role in technology. It creates many
different fields of jobs, including electrical engineering, production,
electronic    communication,     and   light/heat/sound     distribution.
Electromagnetism is used in radio communication, electronics, the
internet, speakers, and so much more!

           HISTORY OF THE
              COMPASS
                                  Compass
                       By definition, a compass is a magnet that
                       always points north. Compasses are used to
                       help people figure out which direction is
                       north which helps them navigate. Sailors and
                       hikers commonly use compasses. Compasses
                       were said invented in Ancient China around
                       1000 years ago, but the Vikings used a very

Other early tech with magnets
You've learned about the compass,
one of the earliest techs that used
magnets. Another example of early
magnetic tech is the cow magnet. A
cow magnet was used to stop metal
that a cow could accidentally eat
from traveling farther inside the cow,
which caused more damage.



Fun Fact: A cow magnet actually goes inside the cow! It stops
metals from traveling farther inside the cow by using its magnetic
forces, which attract the metal to the magnet.

 HOW COMPASS WORKS




Ever wondered how a compass knows which way is North? Well, it's all
thanks to the Earth itself! You see, the Earth is like this huge magnet. It
has a North pole and a South pole, just like the magnets you might have
played with.
A compass is designed with a special needle or magnetized bar that can
move freely. One end of the needle is attracted to the North Pole, while
the other end is pulled towards the South Pole. When you hold the
compass flat, the needle automatically lines up in a North-South
direction. This clever alignment allows us to figure out which way is
North.                                        This orange layer is what gives
                                               Earth its magnetic properties

Earth's Magnetic North Pole
Earth's actual north pole and magnetic
north pole are not precisely the same.
They are about 1200 miles apart. That
number might seem significant, but the
Earth itself is so huge that it barely makes
a difference. Earth's magnetic north pole
changes! The magnetic properties come
from the iron core, which slowly rotates.
In 250 million years, the magnetic north
pole will be on the South pole!


83                    2.5 ELECTROMAGNETS
      ELECTROMAGNETS:
       WHAT ARE THEY?
An electromagnet is a magnet made out
of electricity. A simple electromagnet
consists of a wire wrapped around a
metal pole. The great thing about an
electromagnet is that you can change
how strong you want it to be. The image
on the right is a simple electromagnet;
the battery sends electricity into the
wire, which then magnetizes the nail,
making it a magnet. All electromagnets
have coils that pass electricity. As these
coils turn, the electric current passing
through the coils works to form a
magnetic field. It is this magnetic field
that creates the magnetic abilities of an
electromagnet.

                             that you use contain electromagnets. On
                             the left is a headphone. Headphones are
                             very common, especially among teenagers.
                             Some other common household appliances
                             that    use   electromagnets     are   fans,
                             refrigerators, and microwaves ovens.
                             Clearly, electromagnets play a significant
                             role in and around our house. Learning
                             about these things can help us right now

Without electromagnets,
our lives would be way

Microwaves, like many other machines, utilize electromagnets in their
operation. Electromagnets are created by passing an electric current
through a wire coil, generating a magnetic field. This magnetic field can
be manipulated to achieve specific functions within the microwave.
In a microwave, the main component that employs an electromagnet is
the magnetron. The magnetron is responsible for generating the
microwaves that heat up food. Inside the magnetron, there is a vacuum
tube that houses a filament, a series of resonant cavities, and a
magnetron antenna.
When the microwave is turned on, an electrical current is supplied to
the filament, causing it to heat up and release electrons. These
electrons are accelerated by high voltage and move toward the
resonant cavities. As the electrons move through the cavities, they
interact with the magnetic field generated by the electromagnet.

What is Electricity?
Electricity is a form of energy resulting from the
movement of charged particles, such as electrons
or ions. It is generated by various means, including
chemical reactions, electromagnetism, and
nuclear reactions. Electricity is used to power a
wide range of devices and systems, from small
electronic devices such as smartphones and
computers to large power grids that supply
electricity to cities and industries. Electricity is a
fundamental part of modern life and is used for
lighting,       heating,     transportation,      and
communication, as well as powering many other
applications.

What are Batteries?
A battery is a device that converts stored chemical energy into
electrical energy. Batteries are composed of one or more
electrochemical cells consisting of two electrodes (an anode and a
cathode) separated by an electrolyte. The chemical reactions that
occur within the battery cause electrons to flow through an external
circuit, producing an electrical current that can be used to power
various devices. Batteries power a wide range of devices that we use
daily, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, remote controls,
flashlights, and toys. They are also used in larger items such as cars,
boats, and airplanes and are essential for powering portable and
wireless devices. Without batteries, many of our daily activities would
be much more challenging and inefficient.

       WHAT IS A PENNY
         BATTERY?
Penny Batteries
Penny batteries, also known as voltaic cells,
are a type of battery that can be made at
home using simple materials like copper
coins, zinc nails, and vinegar. They are called
penny batteries because they can be made by
                                                 An electric current is
using pennies as one of the electrodes, an

                                                through an electrolyte,
voltaic cells dates back to the late 18th
                                                 a conducting medium

                                                     that conducts
Alessandro Volta discovered that two

(a conducting medium that conducts present in the medium.
electricity through the movement of ions
present in the medium) could produce an
electric current.



Simple Science
A penny battery uses two different kinds of
metal, like a copper penny and a zinc nail, and
a special liquid called an electrolyte made
from vinegar and salt. When the metals and
the electrolyte are put together correctly, a
chemical reaction occurs, generating a tiny
amount of electricity.

        CAPABILITIES AND
            SAFETY
Uses of a Penny Battery
Although penny batteries are not very powerful, they can still be used
to power small electronic devices or science experiments that require
low levels of electricity. One example of a device that penny batteries
can power is an LED light. By connecting several penny batteries in a
series, it is possible to create a circuit that will light up an LED, which
can be used as a small emergency source of light. Another example of
a device that can be powered by penny batteries is a small motor or
generator. By connecting a penny battery to a simple motor made
from a magnet and a coil of wire, it is possible to create a simple
electric motor that can be used to power a toy or other small devices.



Proper Safety Measures
When working with batteries and electricity, it's essential to be aware
of safety concerns such as electrical shocks, chemical burns, fires,
and explosions. To mitigate these risks, wear appropriate protective
equipment, such as full-sleeved clothing, gloves, and protective
glasses. Also, please store batteries in a cool, dry place. Follow the
proper instructions when using and charging batteries, and turn off
the power supply before working on electrical equipment. Keep a fire
extinguisher and first aid kit on hand in case of a fire, and educate
yourself on how to respond quickly and safely if an accident occurs.

        BUILDING A PENNY
            BATTERY
                         Materials
        Five pennies (after 1982 pennies), mat board, a
        piece of 100-grit sandpaper, salt, wires, water,
                  vinegar, and a red LED light


                       Instructions
1. Make a saturated salt water solution by
mixing 2 tablespoons of salt in a glass of
water until the salt no longer dissolves.
Then, add a spoon of vinegar to the
solution. While doing so, cut the mat
board into 4 separate 1/2-inch squares.


                 2. Soak the mat board pieces in the salt-and-
                 vinegar solution. Once the pieces are thoroughly
                 wet, take them out and place them on a paper
                 towel so they are still damp but not dripping. Use
                 sandpaper to remove the copper from one side of
                 each of the four pennies, and leave the fifth penny
                 intact. Sand until you see zinc (a shiny silver color)
                 covering the entire face of the coin. When you're
                 done, the sanded coins should have a bronze-
                 colored copper side and a silver-colored zinc side.

            BATTERY
3. Take one of your sanded pennies with the
zinc side facing up (copper side down), and
place a damp piece of mat board on it. Then
repeat the process, stacking the pennies on
top of each other in the appropriate order
(zinc side facing up) with a damp 1/2-inch
piece of mat board in between each penny.
Finally, place the unsanded penny at the
very top.



                               4. Lastly,    connect the LED to the
                               penny by      placing one wire at the
                               bottom of     the stack and one at the
                               top. Your      LED should be shining
                               bright red!




How does this work?
Batteries convert chemical energy into electrical energy using two
metal electrodes and an electrolyte. Pennies made after 1982 have zinc
cores that can create a zinc electrode when sanded. By stacking
pennies and matboards soaked in salty vinegar water, you can create a
voltaic pile or battery, generating over 0.6 volts per cell. A stack of
three cells is enough to power a red LED, which is visible throughout
this experiment.
